2108. Find First Palindromic String in the Array
Given an array of strings words, return the first palindromic string in the array. If there is no such string, return an empty string "".
A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.

Example 1:
Input: words = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]
Output: "ada"
Explanation: The first string that is palindromic is "ada".
Note that "racecar" is also palindromic, but it is not the first.

Thank you for providing the queries. Based on the conversation and the queries, here's an analysis:

The conversation is mainly about updating the structure of the surveys.survey_answers table to make querying simpler
for users who need to access survey data. The main issue is the inconsistency in the meaning of survey_id
and survey_template_id between the Admin and FenixDB data sources.

Brianna proposes to change the FenixDB data to make it more consistent with the Admin data:

Set survey_id to the value that is currently in survey_template_id.
Keep survey_version as NULL.
Add a new column, survey_instance_id, to represent the specific survey taken by a specific customer at a specific time.
The provided queries are as follows:

get_survey_questions(): A query that retrieves survey question information from the surveys.survey_questions table.
get_survey_response(last_modified_at_utc): A query that retrieves survey responses from the FenixDB data source based on
a given timestamp (last_modified_at_utc).
get_survey_answers(country_prefix, last_updated_at): A query that retrieves survey answers from the Admin data source based
on a given country prefix and timestamp (last_updated_at).
Now, let's explain the changes and their impact on the queries:

If the proposed changes are implemented, the queries that use the surveys.survey_answers table, specifically the ones
that pull data from the FenixDB source, will need to be updated.

As an example, Brianna provides a before-and-after update of a query that retrieves NPS data. The original query uses both
survey_template_id and survey_id to filter the data, while the updated version of the query will only use survey_id.

To summarize, the conversation and queries are about updating the structure of the surveys.survey_answers table to make it
more consistent and easier to use. The proposed changes will require updating queries that pull data from the FenixDB source,
but these updates should simplify the queries.

Let me know if you need more information or if you have any questions about the code or the conversation.



To make the suggested changes to the structure of the surveys.survey_answers table, you'll need to alter the table schema
and update the query that retrieves survey responses from the FenixDB data source. Here's how you can do that:

Alter the surveys.survey_answers table to add the survey_instance_id column:
ALTER TABLE surveys.survey_answers
ADD COLUMN survey_instance_id INTEGER;


Update the get_survey_response(last_modified_at_utc) function to reflect the proposed changes:

def get_survey_response(last_modified_at_utc):
    """
    Get responses from a subset of surveys in FenixDB that were requested
    to be added in Mzee.
    """
    fenixdb_surveys = utils.get_list_string(
        params.fenixdb_surveys, strings=True, parens=False)

    q = f"""
        select
            ssr.id answer_id,
            ss.creator_id user_id,
            ss.person_id customer_id,
            ssr.date_added started_at_utc,
            ss.date_completed finished_at_utc,
            NULL as survey_version,
            ss.survey_type_id survey_id,  -- Change survey_type_id to survey_id
            ssr.survey_id survey_instance_id,  -- Add the survey_instance_id column
            ssr.date_last_modified updated_at_utc,
            sq.response_name question_name,
            case when ss.date_completed is null then FALSE else TRUE end as completed,
            ssr.value answer,
            NULL as contractor_id,
            'fenixdb' as source
        from survey_surveyresponse ssr
        join survey_survey ss on ss.id=ssr.survey_id
        join survey_surveytype sst on ss.survey_type_id=sst.id
        join survey_question as sq on ssr.question_id = sq.id
        join survey_surveystate as sssta on sssta.id=ss.state_id
        left join crm_person sp on ss.person_id=sp.id
        left join readypay_creditaccount as rca on ss.person_id=rca.user_id
        left join common_country cc on sp.country_id = cc.id
        where ssr.date_last_modified >= '{last_modified_at_utc}'
        and ss.survey_type_id in ({fenixdb_surveys})
        order by ssr.date_last_modified
        {QUERY_LIMIT}
        """

    return q

	After making these changes, you should update any queries that rely on the old structure.
    To provide an example, I would need to see the original NPS query mentioned in the conversation.

Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on these changes.


To implement the changes we've discussed earlier, you'll need to modify the SurveyAnswers class
and the process function in the surveys_answers.py file. Specifically, update the schema to include
the new survey_instance_id column and process the Fenix data accordingly.

Update the schema definition in the SurveyAnswers class to include the survey_instance_id column:

schema = Schema('surveys.survey_answers', [
    # ... other columns ...
    Col("survey_instance_id", "INTEGER"),  # Add this new column
    # ... other columns ...
], insert_timestamp="inserted_at_utc", id_column="primary_id",
   dist_key='customer_id', sort_keys=['updated_at_utc'])


Modify the process function to include the survey_instance_id column when appending the Fenix data:
# ...
columns = ['answer_id', 'user_id', 'customer_id', 'started_at_utc', 'finished_at_utc', 'survey_version',
           'survey_template_id', 'survey_id', 'updated_at_utc', 'question_name', 'completed', 'answer',
           'source', 'contractor_id', 'survey_instance_id']  # Add 'survey_instance_id' to the list

logging.info('Add Fenix data.')
response_fnx['customer_id'] = response_fnx['customer_id'].astype('Int32')
response_fnx['completed'] = np.where(response_fnx['completed'] == 1, 'True', 'False')

survey_answers = combined[columns].append(response_fnx)
# ...

With these changes, the surveys.survey_answers table should now include the survey_instance_id column, and
the ETL process should handle the data from the Fenix data source accordingly.





The changes made so far should cover the main requirements you mentioned. Here's a quick summary of what we've done:

Updated the schema to include the survey_instance_id column.
Modified the process function to include the survey_instance_id column when appending the Fenix data.
Before deploying the updated code, it's a good idea to:

Test the code locally with sample data to ensure the changes work as expected.
Validate that the data in the surveys.survey_answers table has the correct values and format for the survey_instance_id column.
Check for any dependencies in your code or other processes that might be affected by the addition of the survey_instance_id column.
Ensure proper error handling and logging are in place to handle any unexpected issues during the ETL process.
Once you've completed these checks and are confident that the changes work as expected, you can deploy the updated code to your production environment.
